## Overview
Resonant is a personal software project exploring how data-driven systems and web technologies can improve discovery of underground and independent music. The project focuses on analyzing user-provided musical preferences to surface lesser-known artists, enable users to curate playlists of discovered tracks, and foster community interaction around music sharing and discussion.
This project serves as an end-to-end exploration of product design, data processing concepts, and recommendation system fundamentals using real-world music metadata. While the concept could evolve into a standalone product, the current implementation is developed as a technical and analytical personal project demonstrating full-cycle software development and system design.

## Objectives
* Design a system that supports discovery of underground music beyond mainstream recommendation channels
* Explore methods for generating personalized suggestions using user-input preference signals
* Apply data processing and feature engineering concepts to music metadata
* Build playlist creation tools centered on discovery
* Develop community-oriented interaction features for sharing music, artists, and playlists
* Implement a functional front-end interface connected to evolving backend logic

## Project Scope & Status
* Landing page and email waitlist implemented
* Core front-end layout and user interaction flows manually designed and built
* Underground recommendation logic in early-stage development
* Playlist creation and saving functionality planned and prototyped
* Community interaction features in design phase

## Tools
**Frontend**
* HTML, Tailwind CSS
* JavaScript

**Backend / Analysis (Planned & In Progress)**
* Python for data processing and recommendation logic
* Public music metadata and audio feature datasets
* SoundCloud and Last.fm APIs

**Development**
* Git/GitHub for version control and documentation
* Vercel for website deployment

## Methodology
* Collect user-input data such as favorite artists and playlists
* Enrich tracks with metadata and audio characteristics
* Engineer features representing tempo, mood, and stylistic similarity
* Prototype recommendation generation using similarity-based approaches
* Generate recommendations based on similarity and user preference signals
* Design community interaction flows for sharing and feedback
* Iteratively refine system behavior based on testing and evaluation

## Key Features (Prototype & Planned)
* Personalized music recommendations based on user taste
* Discovery of underground and independent artists
* User sharing of playlists, artists, and tracks
* Explainable recommendation outputs
* Community-based discovery features
* Scalable foundation for future recommendation experimentation

## Technical Focus Areas
* Data cleaning and feature engineering
* Similarity modeling and clustering concepts
* Recommendation system design
* Front-end and backend integration
* Human-centered design for explainable AI systems

## Future Improvements
* Full Spotify/Apple Music API integration
* Support for additional music platforms
* Improved recommendation accuracy through user feedback loops
* Enhanced community interaction tooling
* Scalable backend architecture
* Visualization of taste profiles and listening patterns
